If you would like to join us at our church service on a Sunday morning, you’ll be given a warm welcome. There’s no obligation – you can just come along and take part in as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. During all of our regular meetings we provide separate activities for [children](/pages/what-we-do/children-and-families/#sundays) and [young people](/pages/what-we-do/youth/#sundays). 

We meet at 10am every week. In addition to our [regular services](#regular-meetings), at the begining of the month we have a more [informal café-style meeting](#cafe-church), and at the end of the month we have an [all-age 'Mosaic' service](#mosaic-sundays).
