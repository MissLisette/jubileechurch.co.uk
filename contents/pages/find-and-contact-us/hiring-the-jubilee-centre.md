The Jubilee Centre is available for use by the community, on a fixed donation basis. However, please note that the centre has some limitations for use and so we are unable to hire it out for parties â€“ for adults or children.

If you are want to find out more about use of the Jubilee Centre, please contact <info@jubileechurch.co.uk>.
